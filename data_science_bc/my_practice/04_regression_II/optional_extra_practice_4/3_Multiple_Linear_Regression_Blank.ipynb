    "##### 1. Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have the normal equation as the OLS estimate for $\\hat{\\beta}$ it is sometimes not ideal to to use that equation to find the estimate. This is because if there are too many features it can be computationally costly to perform the inverse operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Gradient Descent Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "One alternative to the normal equation is to perform gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\ell(\\beta)$ denote a loss function. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we remember some Calculus III we can remember that for a particular value of $\\beta$, say $\\beta^*$, the direction of greatest descent for $\\ell$ at $\\beta^*$, i.e. how to get to the minimum of $\\ell$ most quickly from $\\beta^*$, is the opposite direction of the gradient, $-\\nabla \\ell(\\beta^*)$. You can thus approach the value of $\\beta$ that minimizes $\\ell$ by iteratively updating $\\beta$ by moving in $\\alpha$ sized steps in the direction of greatest descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For linear regression our loss function, $\\ell$, is the mean square error, MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write out an algorithm (in mathematical symbols not code) that leverages the gradient of the loss function to find the optimal $\\hat{\\beta}$ for multiple linear regression."
